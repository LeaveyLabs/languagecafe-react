## general

&nbsp;

### what is Language Cafe?

Language Cafe is an app that sends you a notification when your next match is right around the corner.

&nbsp;

### why **did you create Language Cafe?**

on dating apps, most matches don’t leave the dms. you might exchange a few texts, but it’s unlikely you’ll actually meet up in person.

we wanted to help people make real connections in real life by making the process more spontaneous and exciting.

&nbsp;

### when **was Language Cafe created?**

Language Cafe was first launched on valentines day in spring 2023.

&nbsp;

### who can join Language Cafe?

Language Cafe is currently only available to usc students.

&nbsp;

### does Language Cafe have any external affiliations?

Language Cafe is not affiliated with any organizations or institutions in any way.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## the app

&nbsp;

### how does it work?

#### 1. take the compatibility test
we'll score your compatibility with others based on your personality, interests & values.

#### 2. get a notification when your next match walks nearby
you both can see your compatibility and have 5 minutes to respond.

#### 3. go and say hi!
if you both press "meet up", you can temporarily chat & share your locations to spontaneously find each other and say hi.&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### how close do we need to be to get matched?

you’ll only be matched with people in walking distance from you—mostly less than 500 feet away.

&nbsp;

### i signed up and took the test. now what?

just make sure your status is “active” and you’re good to go! live your life and let the app do the work in the background.

as you walk around, you might suddenly get a notification that someone highly compatible for you is around the corner. if you’re down, just press “meet up!”

&nbsp;

### please tell me there’s a cute notification sound that plays when i get matched?

omg how did you know

&nbsp;

### i just got matched and I want to meet them but i’m running late to class 😭

is love more important than grades? are they worth it?

that’s up for you to decide.

seriously though, we’d be happy to explain any tardiness to your prof if you were busy connecting with someone through Language Cafe. just text us at 615 975 4270

&nbsp;

### oh my god, we both said “yes” to meeting up. now what!

this is where things get exciting!

you and your match will both have 5 minutes to find each other and say hi.

at any time, you can end the match and location sharing will stop.

&nbsp;

### i’m looking like shit today and don’t wanna be matched…

dw, we’ve been there too.

if you don’t want to be matched with anyone for some time, you can always become inactive.

on the home screen, press the “active” button to toggle your status between active and inactive.

just make sure to turn your status back to “active” once you’re down to start meeting new people again ;)

&nbsp;

### why do i need to enable location and notifications?

well, they’re both essential for the app to work.

your location is updated as you walk around so you can find out if you walk by someone who’s just for you.

notifications are necessary because all matches are spontaneous—you both only get a few minutes to respond.

&nbsp;

### what happens with my location data btw?

we take privacy very seriously.

your test responses & location data is encrypted and only used to find your next match. all location data is deleted within 24 hours, and no data is shared under any circumstances. 

learn more in our **[privacy policy](languagecafe.app/privacy)**.

&nbsp;

### will the app affect my phone’s battery life?

we use newly released Apple APIs to keep battery usage to a minimum. through our tests, we couldn’t detect any effect the app had on battery life. 

&nbsp;

### when **will it be available on Android?**

our app is powered by Apple’s new APIs. unfortunately, these are unavailable on Android, so we don’t have a release date at this time. 

sorry green text fam <3

## compatibility test

&nbsp;

### so what’s this compatibility test?

we use the power of human beauty and artifical intelligence to power a state of the art compatibilty test.

&nbsp;

### what are some examples of compatibility?

we find similarities in your qualities (creative, minimalistic) interests (the outdoors, music festivals), and values (Muslim, vegetarian). 

we also only match you with people in a close age range to you.

&nbsp;

### how accurate are the matchings?

100% accurate.

&nbsp;

### right…
